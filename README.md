# Branch only for server code examples
## Example 1
- Using djongo to handle access to database
- For grpc server using grpc server with 10 workers
- Django is mainly here for access to djongo
- Not really rich implementation, probably won't be used in the future
## Example 2
- Using beanie as ODM that uses Pydantic and Motor
- For grpc server using grpc.aio server
- Has better exception handling and probably better support for the future
